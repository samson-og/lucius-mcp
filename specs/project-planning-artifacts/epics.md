### Story 8.1: MCP Server Authentication (OAuth/OIDC via NGINX Ingress)

As a DevOps Engineer,
I want to secure the MCP server with OAuth 2.0/OIDC authentication at the infrastructure level,
So that only authorized clients can access the lucius-mcp tools and resources.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an MCP server deployed behind NGINX Ingress
**When** OAuth2 Proxy is configured with an OIDC provider (e.g., Auth0, Okta, Keycloak)
**Then** all requests to the MCP server require valid OAuth tokens
**And** unauthenticated requests are redirected to the OAuth login flow

So that we meet enterprise security standards and can investigate incidents.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a production MCP server deployment
**When** the Helm chart is configured with security policies
**Then** rate limiting is enforced at the NGINX Ingress level (e.g., max 100 requests/minute per client IP)
**And** IP allowlisting restricts access to approved networks via Ingress annotations
**And** all authenticated requests are logged by the application with structured audit trails (user, timestamp, tool invoked, result)
**And** audit logs are written in JSON format and exportable for SIEM integration
**And** the Helm chart provides configurable values for rate limits, allowed IPs, and log retention.

  - Tool API reference with examples
  - Testing guidelines and standards
  - Troubleshooting common issues
**And** documentation is kept up-to-date with code changes
**And** code examples are tested and verified
**And** diagrams reflect the actual system architecture

### Story 9.2: FastMCP CLI Integration

As a Developer or QA Engineer,
I want a universal CLI entry point `lucius` with subcommands that provide type-safe access to all MCP tools,
so that I can execute lucius-mcp functionality directly from the command line without requiring an MCP client runtime.

**CLI Design Principles (Course Correction):**

1. **No MCP/Python Logs in Output**
   - CLI should never display MCP server logs or Python tracebacks
   - Only user-facing error messages shown
   - All exceptions caught and formatted as clear error messages

2. **Guiding Error Messages**
   - Tool call errors provide guiding messages explaining what went wrong
   - Validation errors show meaningful hints (same as MCP server behavior)
   - Error messages include suggestions for fixes

3. **Use MCP Tools, Don't Reimplement**
   - CLI uses MCP server tools directly
   - CLI does NOT reimplement business logic or API calls
   - CLI is thin wrapper around MCP tools for command-line access
   - Exception: CLI-specific functionality like --version, --help

4. **Individual Tool Help**
   - Every tool has its own `--help` command
   - `lucius call <tool_name> --help` shows isolated tool documentation
   - Help includes: tool description, parameters, types, formats, examples
   - Help generated from MCP tool schema (not duplicated)

5. **Multiple Output Formats**
   - Every command supports: JSON, table, plain
   - JSON is the DEFAULT output format
   - Flag: `--format json|table|plain` or `-f json|table|plain`
   - Consistent output formatting across all commands

6. **Lazy Client Initialization**
   - `lucius list` uses static info built at build time
   - No MCP client initialization for `lucius list`
   - MCP client initialized ONLY when `lucius call <tool>` invoked
   - ONLY called tool loaded (eager imports removed from CLI entry point)
   - Fast startup (~< 1s) for help/version/list commands

7. **No HTTP Server in CLI**
   - HTTP server never imported or used in CLI
   - CLI uses stdio transport only
   - No Starlette, uvicorn, or HTTP-related imports in CLI code
   - Compiled binary must NOT include HTTP server components

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a lucius-mcp installation
**When** I run CLI commands
**Then** the following commands are available and work correctly:

**P0 (Must-Have):**

1. **CLI Entry Point**: Universal CLI entry point `lucius` with subcommands following pattern `lucius <command> [options]`

2. **Single Binary Distribution**: Compile CLI to standalone binaries using nuitka for:
   - Linux (ARM64, x86_64)
   - macOS (ARM64, x86_64)
   - Windows (ARM64, x86_64)

3. **Type-Safe Interface**: Implement type-safe CLI commands using cyclopts framework, leveraging JSON schemas from MCP tool definitions

4. **Core Commands**:
   - `lucius list [--format json|table|plain]` - List available tools using build-time static data (no MCP client)
   - `lucius call <tool_name> --args <json> [--format json|table|plain]` - Execute MCP tools via CLI
   - `lucius call <tool_name> --help` - Show isolated tool documentation from static schema
   - `lucius --help` - Display help and usage information
   - `lucius --version` - Display version information

5. **Clean Error Output**:
   - No MCP server logs in CLI output
   - No Python tracebacks in CLI output
   - Only user-facing error messages with guidance displayed
   - Tool call errors provide guiding messages
   - Validation errors show meaningful hints

6. **Tool Help Isolation**: Every tool has isolated `--help` generated from MCP schema including description, parameters, types, formats, examples

7. **Output Format Support**: All commands support JSON (default), table, and plain output formats

8. **Lazy Initialization**:
   - CLI starts fast (~< 1s) for help/version/list commands
   - MCP client initialized only on `lucius call <tool>` invocation
   - Only called tool loaded (no eager imports)
   - `lucius list` uses build-time static info

**P1 (Should-Have):**

9. **Tab Completion**: Support shell completion for commands and tool names

10. **E2E Test Coverage**: Implement E2E tests covering all CLI commands and tool invocations

11. **Packaging Tests**: Add packaging tests for all 6 target platforms to verify binary functionality

12. **No HTTP Dependencies**: Verify HTTP server components (Starlette, uvicorn) not imported or bundled in compiled binary

13. **Error Handling**: Provide clear, helpful error messages with guiding hints for invalid arguments or API errors

14. **Use MCP Tools**: Verify CLI uses MCP tools directly, no reimplemented business logic

**P2 (Nice-to-Have):**

15. **Documentation**: Comprehensive CLI documentation including installation, usage, building, troubleshooting

16. **Docker Integration**: Support running the CLI in Docker containers for consistent environments

17. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build and test pipeline for all platform binaries

### Story 9.5: Nuitka Onefile Caching for CLI Startup

As a Release Engineer,
I want onefile CLI binaries to use persistent extraction caching,
so that repeated command startup is fast without significantly increasing binary size.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the current onefile build configuration and benchmark variants
**When** we compare startup time and artifact size
**Then** Variant 2 (`onefile` + persistent `onefile-tempdir-spec` + `onefile-cache-mode=cached`) is selected as default
**And** Variant 3 (`--onefile-no-compression`) is not selected as default due to large artifact growth.

**Given** all currently supported OS targets (Linux, macOS, Windows; arm64/x86_64)
**When** binaries run with onefile cache enabled
**Then** extraction cache uses native OS cache roots
**And** cache paths are version-scoped and stable
**And** cache from older binary version is not reused after version increase.

**Given** benchmark documentation and packaging tests
**When** maintainers validate startup behavior
**Then** first-run (cold) and subsequent-run (warm) behavior is reproducible
**And** warm-start performance improvement over current configuration is verified.

### Story 9.6: Tool-to-CLI Output Contract (Tools JSON Default, CLI Table/CSV Rendering)

As a Developer or QA Engineer,
I want CLI to ingest and display data returned by tools through a consistent output contract,
so that tool output is machine-friendly by default while CLI still supports human-friendly table/csv views.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** any tool returning a payload
**When** output format is not explicitly requested
**Then** tool output defaults to `json`
**And** tools support `plain|json` output modes only
**And** this default change is treated as a breaking change.

**Given** CLI execution (`lucius <entity> <action>`)
**When** output is rendered
**Then** CLI supports `plain|json|table|csv`
**And** `table` and `csv` are CLI-only renderers (not tool output modes).

**Given** CLI invokes mapped tools
**When** tools return `json` (default) or `plain`
**Then** CLI ingests tool output and renders requested format deterministically
**And** no traceback/internal logs are printed for normal format handling.

**Given** plain text payloads containing escaped newline sequences (`\n`)
**When** plain output is displayed
**Then** `\n` is rendered as a line break (not literal backslash+n).

**Given** Story 9.6 implementation
**When** integration tests run
**Then** tests verify AC behavior and tool->CLI data flow for:
**And** tool default `json`
**And** tool `plain`
**And** CLI rendering `plain|json|table|csv`
**And** newline normalization
**And** deterministic table/csv columns for multi-record results.

**Given** Story 9.6 implementation
**When** documentation is updated
**Then** `specs/prd.md` and `specs/architecture.md` document:
**And** tool output contract (`plain|json`, default `json`)
**And** CLI-only renderer contract (`table|csv`)
**And** end-to-end data flow from tools to CLI.

**Given** Story 9.6 introduces a breaking output-contract change
**When** implementation changes are committed
**Then** commit message follows Conventional Commits with breaking marker `!` (for example `feat(cli)!: ...`)
**And** commit body includes `BREAKING CHANGE:` details.

**Given** the full set of exposed tools/routes
**When** output is produced and consumed by CLI
**Then** every tool follows `plain|json` output contract with default `json`
**And** CLI returns tool `plain`/`json` outputs without content changes
**And** CLI applies output rendering transformations only for `table|csv`.

### Story 9.7: CLI Auth Command with Persistent Configuration

As a Developer or QA Engineer,
I want `lucius auth` to prompt for my Allure TestOps URL, API token, and default project,
so that subsequent CLI launches can reuse those credentials without requiring environment variables every time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I run `lucius auth`
**When** no non-interactive values are supplied
**Then** the CLI prompts for Allure TestOps base URL, API token, and project ID
**And** token input is masked and never echoed.

**Given** URL, token, and project ID are entered
**When** the command validates the credentials
**Then** it authenticates through the existing Allure client token exchange
**And** it verifies the configured project is accessible before saving.

**Given** validation succeeds
**When** credentials are saved
**Then** the config file is stored under the native user config directory using `platformdirs.user_config_path("lucius", appauthor=False, ensure_exists=True) / "auth.json"`
**And** Linux/Unix, macOS, and Windows resolve to their OS-specific user config roots.

**Given** a saved auth config exists
**When** I run a subsequent CLI command
**Then** the CLI uses saved URL, token, and project values when matching environment variables are absent
**And** explicit tool args and real environment variables retain precedence over saved config.

**Given** this story is implemented
**When** help, docs, and tests are updated
**Then** `lucius auth --help`, `lucius auth status`, CLI docs, setup docs, and cross-platform config tests cover the behavior
**And** shell completion generation includes `auth` and auth-specific subcommands/options for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell
**And** the raw token is never printed, logged, or shown in status output
**And** source-invoked CLI E2E tests run the command via `uv run lucius ...` rather than a built binary.

### Story 9.8: CLI List Command Tool Table

As a Developer or QA Engineer,
I want `lucius list` to display the same available-tools discovery table as running `lucius` without arguments,
so that I can explicitly list supported CLI capabilities without relying on an empty invocation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I run `lucius list`
**When** the CLI starts
**Then** it exits successfully
**And** it prints the same discovery table content as `lucius` with no arguments.

**Given** I run `lucius list --help`
**When** help is requested
**Then** the CLI describes `list` as a local discovery command
**And** it does not require `--args` or TestOps credentials.

**Given** the `list` command is used
**When** output is generated
**Then** it uses build-time static metadata from `src/cli/data/tool_schemas.json` and `src/cli/route_matrix.py`
**And** it does not import `src.tools`, `src.main`, FastMCP, Starlette, or any HTTP server components.

**Given** existing entity/action commands
**When** `lucius list` is added
**Then** `lucius call ...` remains rejected as legacy command style
**And** `list` is not added to the canonical TestOps route matrix as a fake entity or action.

**Given** shell completions are generated
**When** users request top-level command completion for `lucius`
**Then** `list` is offered alongside `help`, `version`, and entity tokens in bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell completions
**And** completion scripts are regenerated from `deployment/scripts/generate_completions.py`.

**Given** automated tests run
**When** CLI tests execute
**Then** they verify `lucius list` success, content parity with no-argument output, `lucius list --help`, shell completion exposure, legacy `call` rejection, and no Python tracebacks/internal logs
**And** process-level CLI E2E coverage invokes `uv run lucius list ...` from source, not via a built binary.

### Story 9.9: CLI Pretty JSON Output Flag

As a Developer or QA Engineer,
I want an optional `--pretty` flag for commands that assume JSON output,
so that JSON responses are easy to read with line breaks and indentation while compact output remains the default.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I run `lucius <entity> <action>` with `--pretty` and no explicit `--format`
**When** the command executes successfully
**Then** CLI still requests tool `output_format=json`
**And** CLI renders the JSON result in pretty (multi-line indented) form.

**Given** I run `lucius <entity> <action> --format json --pretty`
**When** output is produced
**Then** CLI renders pretty JSON deterministically
**And** no traceback/internal logs are shown.

**Given** I run commands without `--pretty`
**When** outputs are rendered
**Then** existing behavior remains unchanged for `json|plain|table|csv`.

**Given** I pass `--pretty` with `--format plain`, `--format table`, or `--format csv`
**When** argument validation runs
**Then** CLI returns a clear guided error indicating `--pretty` is valid only for JSON output.

**Given** help/docs/completions are updated for this feature
**When** users inspect CLI help and shell completion
**Then** action usage includes `--pretty`
**And** docs clarify JSON-only applicability
**And** generated bash/zsh/fish/PowerShell completion scripts include `--pretty` for action options
**And** source-invoked CLI E2E tests validate `--pretty` behavior via `uv run lucius ...`.

### Story 9.10: CLI Install Completions Command

As a Developer or QA Engineer,
I want `lucius install-completions` to detect my shell and install the matching completion script from the binary,
so that standalone CLI users can enable tab completion without locating repository files or manually copying generated scripts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I run `lucius install-completions`
**When** the shell can be detected from an explicit `--shell` option or the current process environment
**Then** the CLI installs the matching completion script for bash, zsh, fish, or PowerShell
**And** it reports the installed path and any shell-specific reload/source instruction.

**Given** I run `lucius install-completions --shell bash|zsh|fish|powershell`
**When** the command executes
**Then** the explicit shell value overrides auto-detection
**And** unsupported shell values fail with a clean `CLIError` and a hint listing supported shells.

**Given** the CLI is running as a Nuitka standalone or onefile binary
**When** `install-completions` installs scripts
**Then** the completion script content comes from code/data embedded in the binary
**And** the command does not read `deployment/shell-completions/*`, `deployment/scripts/generate_completions.py`, the source checkout, or network resources at runtime.

**Given** completion scripts are generated or installed
**When** users request top-level command completion for `lucius`
**Then** `install-completions` is offered alongside existing top-level commands and entity tokens in bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell completions
**And** the command itself supports completion/help for `--shell`, `--path`, `--force`, `--print`, `--help`, and `-h`.

**Given** completion installation would overwrite an existing script or shell startup hook
**When** the target already exists
**Then** the command preserves existing files unless `--force` is supplied
**And** any startup-file edits are idempotent, marker-delimited, and never duplicate prior Lucius blocks.

**Given** automated tests run
**Then** they verify shell detection, explicit shell override, per-shell install paths, embedded-content behavior without repository completion files, completion exposure for `install-completions`, clean errors/no tracebacks, and docs coverage
**And** process-level CLI E2E coverage invokes `uv run lucius install-completions ...` from source, not via a built binary.

### Story 9.11: CLI Human-Readable Table Dates with Local Timezone Fallback

As a Developer or QA Engineer,
I want `lucius ... --format table` to render date/time values in a human-readable form using my local timezone when possible,
so that operational data is easier to read without manual timestamp conversion.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** CLI table rendering receives JSON payload values that represent datetimes (for example epoch seconds/milliseconds or ISO-8601 strings)
**When** output is rendered with `--format table`
**Then** datetime values are shown in a human-readable datetime format
**And** non-datetime values remain unchanged.

**Given** local timezone can be resolved from the runtime environment
**When** datetime values are rendered in table output
**Then** values are converted to local timezone consistently for the command output
**And** the rendered table explicitly states which timezone was used.

**Given** local timezone cannot be resolved or conversion fails
**When** table output includes datetime values
**Then** CLI falls back to UTC conversion
**And** the rendered output explicitly states timezone as `UTC`
**And** command execution still succeeds without traceback/internal logs.

**Given** other output modes are requested
**When** output is rendered as `json`, `plain`, or `csv`
**Then** existing output-contract behavior remains unchanged.

**Given** automated tests run
**When** formatter and CLI tests execute
**Then** they verify local-timezone rendering, UTC fallback, explicit timezone labeling, deterministic formatting, and unchanged behavior for non-table formats
**And** source-invoked CLI E2E tests validate table rendering behavior via `uv run lucius ...`.

### Story 9.12: CLI Short Entity Aliases

As a Developer or QA Engineer,
I want short aliases for common CLI entities such as `tc` for `test_case`,
so that frequent `lucius <entity> <action>` commands are faster to type while preserving the canonical entity/action model.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the canonical CLI entity/action matrix
**When** short entity aliases are configured
**Then** each alias resolves to exactly one canonical entity
**And** aliases are defined in the existing route-matrix alias source, not in a parallel parser or duplicate route table.

**Given** I use a supported short entity alias such as `tc`
**When** I run entity discovery or an action command
**Then** the CLI behaves exactly as if I used the canonical entity name
**And** examples such as `lucius tc`, `lucius tc list --help`, and `lucius tc list --args '{}'` resolve to `test_case`.

**Given** short aliases are exposed to users
**When** I run root help, entity help, or shell completion generation
**Then** short aliases are discoverable alongside existing canonical, plural, and dash-form aliases
**And** generated bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell completions include the short aliases.

**Given** alias input contains uppercase letters, leading/trailing spaces, or dash/underscore variants where applicable
**When** the CLI normalizes the token
**Then** aliases resolve consistently using the existing `normalize_token()` behavior
**And** invalid or ambiguous aliases produce clean guided errors without Python tracebacks.

**Given** automated tests run
**When** CLI alias and completion tests execute
**Then** they verify short alias resolution, no canonical route duplication, root-help visibility, completion exposure, and unchanged behavior for existing canonical/plural/dash aliases
**And** process-level CLI E2E coverage exercises representative short aliases via `uv run lucius ...`.

### Story 9.13: CLI Comprehensive E2E Coverage via uv run lucius

As a Developer or QA Engineer,
I want comprehensive CLI command E2E coverage executed from source with `uv run lucius`,
so that CLI behavior is verified end-to-end without depending on built binaries and regressions in local commands or high-priority entity flows are caught early.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the CLI E2E suite is executed
**When** command processes are launched
**Then** commands are invoked from source via `uv run lucius ...`
**And** the suite does not require building a Nuitka or wheel binary to validate CLI behavior.

**Given** CLI commands that do not call a TestOps tool directly
**When** process-level E2E tests run
**Then** coverage includes `lucius`, `lucius --help`, `lucius --version`, `lucius <entity>`, `lucius <entity> <action> --help`, and each CLI-local command introduced in Epic 9 such as `list`, `auth`, `auth status`, and `install-completions`
**And** those tests verify clean exit codes, no tracebacks/internal logs, and expected discovery/help text.

**Given** high-priority `test_case` command flows
**When** source-invoked CLI E2E tests run
**Then** they cover representative discovery, help, and execution paths for `test_case`
**And** they verify default JSON routing plus CLI rendering for `plain`, `table`, and `csv`
**And** they continue to validate escaped-newline handling in plain output.

**Given** high-priority `launch` command flows
**When** source-invoked CLI E2E tests run
**Then** they cover representative discovery, help, and execution paths for `launch`
**And** they validate at least one list/read flow and at least one state-transition flow relevant to launch lifecycle behavior.

**Given** high-priority custom-field flows
**When** source-invoked CLI E2E tests run
**Then** they cover representative discovery, help, and execution paths for `custom_field` and `custom_field_value`
**And** they validate behavior for both entity-level operations and value-level CRUD-style flows.

**Given** staged CLI features such as pretty JSON, local-timezone table rendering, and short aliases
**When** those features are implemented
**Then** the source-invoked E2E suite contains representative process tests for them
**And** aliases such as `tc`, `ln`, `cf`, or `cfv` are covered where the corresponding story makes them available.

**Given** future CLI-local commands or CLI-only rendering behaviors are added
**When** a story is prepared for development
**Then** its acceptance criteria explicitly require extending the shared `uv run lucius` CLI E2E suite
**And** story tasks identify the concrete test file(s) to update.


## Epic 10: Quality of Life and API Coverage

Goal: Improve day-to-day agent usability and close API coverage gaps without changing the service-first architecture or existing output contracts.

### Story 10.1: Include TestOps Entity URLs in Tool Responses

As an AI Agent,
I want tool responses that mention TestOps entity IDs to also include browser URLs for those entities,
so that I can navigate users directly to the relevant TestOps objects without manually reconstructing links.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a tool response includes a stable TestOps entity ID
**When** the tool returns either `plain` or `json`
**Then** it includes the existing ID field unchanged
**And** it includes a corresponding `url` field or plain-text `URL:` line for that same entity
**And** existing output-format support remains limited to `plain|json`.

**Given** a tool uses an optional `project_id` override or runtime auth project context
**When** a URL is generated
**Then** the URL uses the resolved `AllureClient.get_base_url()` and `AllureClient.get_project()` values
**And** it does not use `settings.ALLURE_PROJECT_ID` directly after a client context has been resolved.

**Given** a response contains multiple entity references, such as a defect linked to a test case
**When** the JSON payload is rendered
**Then** every referenced entity with a known stable browser URL includes a type-specific URL field
**And** field names are unambiguous, for example `defect_url`, `test_case_url`, `launch_url`, or nested item `url`.

**Given** entity list tools return paginated or collection payloads
**When** each item contains an entity ID
**Then** each item includes its own `url`
**And** the plain output includes URLs without breaking the existing ID/name/status lines that tests and agents already parse.

**Given** an entity type does not have a verified stable browser URL pattern
**When** implementation reaches that type
**Then** the developer must either verify the URL against a sandbox TestOps instance and add tests
**Or** omit the URL for that entity and document why it is intentionally unsupported
**And** the implementation must not invent unverified links for settings-only or non-navigable API records.

**Given** automated tests run
**When** unit, integration, and selected e2e tests execute
**Then** they verify URL generation for test cases, launches, defects, test plans, and shared steps
**And** they verify output remains backward compatible for existing ID parsing and CLI formatting.

## Epic 11: Telemetry Signal Simplification

Goal: Simplify telemetry event naming so analytics stay queryable without encoding tool names, deployment methods, or error classes in the event name itself.

### Story 11.1: Flatten Telemetry Event Names

As a Lucius maintainer,
I want telemetry events to use flat top-level names such as `startup`, `tool_use`, and `tool_error`,
so that downstream dashboards can group events consistently while keeping the same runtime properties in the payload.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** Lucius emits a startup telemetry event
**When** telemetry is enabled
**Then** the event name is exactly `startup`
**And** the payload still includes `deployment_method`, `mcp_mode`, `server_version`, and the other existing startup properties.

**Given** Lucius emits a successful tool telemetry event
**When** any tool finishes successfully
**Then** the event name is exactly `tool_use`
**And** the payload still includes `tool_name`, `outcome`, `duration_bucket`, and the existing runtime context fields.

**Given** Lucius emits a failed tool telemetry event
**When** validation, auth, API, or unexpected failures occur
**Then** the event name is exactly `tool_error`
**And** the payload still includes `tool_name`, `outcome`, and `error_category`
**And** the implementation does not add replacement sublevels such as `tool_error.validation`.

**Given** existing telemetry dashboards or tests need deployment method, tool identity, or error class
**When** they read the event payload
**Then** those dimensions are still available as properties
**And** no existing payload field is removed solely because the event name was flattened.

**Given** telemetry docs and automated tests are updated
**When** maintainers review the change
**Then** docs describe the flat event taxonomy explicitly
**And** unit, integration, and e2e tests assert the new event names without weakening payload coverage.
